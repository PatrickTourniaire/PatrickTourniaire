## Hi there, I'm Patrick Tourniaire ðŸ‘‹

Hi there!

I am a master's student in Artificial Intelligence & Advanced Visual Computing at Ã‰cole Polytechnique, one of the leading engineering schools in France and Europe. I have a strong background in Artificial Intelligence & Computer Science, having graduated with a first class honours degree from the University of Edinburgh. I am passionate about learning new technologies and techniques in AI/ML, and I am eager to apply them to real-world problems and opportunities.
